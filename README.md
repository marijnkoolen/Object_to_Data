Course description From Object to Data

## Learning Objectives

- knowledge of digital and programmatic concepts for working with data
- insight in the relevance of data-oriented research for humanities disciplines
- skills in structuring digital research around a research question in the form of a recipe

## Summary

How can researchers of history, visual arts, literature, media, theatre or religion use data to support their research? What digital tools are at their disposal and can provide new perspectives and research questions? Following the Coding the Humanities course, this course looks at digital data sources and tools that are relevant to the humanities from a programmatic perspective. ...

## Weekly Overview

### Week 1: Objects as Data Points

- Shifting perspective on humanities material from objects as objects to objects as data points
- Using data to tell stories
- Introduction to 7 steps of data-oriented research. The 7 steps provide a workflow to organise your research approach in clearly defined and ordered steps, resulting in a research recipe.
- Start working with the 7-step workflow
- Step 0: defining your research, determining your research question
- From research question to workflow, structuring research approach
- Concepts: hypothesis, types of data (metadata, textual data, visual data, audio data), static, streaming and real-time data

### Week 2: Acquiring data

- Focus on online sources of data. What data is available? What data is relevant to the research question?
- Step 1 of 7: gathering data
- Evaluating data sources and data sets. When is data appropriate? When is it representative?
- Concepts: data objects, data formats, data dumps, APIs, queries, iteration, sampling
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 3: Handling Metadata

Any type of object or event can be described. Such descriptions contain data about data, also known as metadata. Metadata is relevant to all humanities disciplines, as well as for any other discipline. 
- Steps 2 & 3 of 7: parsing and filtering
- Filtering metadata to focus on what is relevant to your research and the story you want to tell.
- Parsing data to create meaning
- Concepts: data storage, data formats, JSON, XML, segmenting, identifying
- getting data in a manageable, comprehensible form
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 4: Handling Raw Data

Complex data objects like texts, musical scores and images can be segmented into units in many different ways. But what are the relevant units for your analysis? For instance, what are the relevant units for analysing a painting? What aspects of images can be identified and segmented into individual units of data? Can we identify objects? Individual brush strokes? 

- Parsing and filtering texts and images
- Regular expressions for text analysis
- Concepts: data units, segmenting `unstructured' data
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 5: Exploring Metadata

- Steps 4, 5 & 6: mining, representing, refining
- Once the data is in manageable form, we can start exploring
- Hunting for stories, bring out meaningful information 
- Concepts: data facets, summarising, aggregating, 
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 6: Exploring Raw Data

How do you choose a visual model that allows you to explore your data and discover areas of interest? How do you choose a representative visual model that supports the story that you want to tell?

- Steps 4, 5 & 6: mining, representing, refining
- Concepts: clustering, sorting, ordering, visual models, patterns, trees, networks
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 7: Interacting with Data

- Step 7: interacting with data, as a researcher and as a user.
- How can interacting with data bring out the story that you want to tell?
- Concepts: ...
- Continue with the workflow

### Week 8: Presenting Data

- Concepts:



### To Do

- Example projects
- Example research questions
- Interesting Humanities problems related to each step
